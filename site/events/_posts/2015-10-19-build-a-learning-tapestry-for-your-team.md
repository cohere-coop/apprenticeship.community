Learning tapestries re-inforce what skills, abilities, and experiences
are valuable on your team as well as to provide guidance and structure as
team members grow.

This two hour, remote workshop is geared towards managers and technical leaders
who are looking for ways to better guide and support their team members as they
build their skills.

We'll start  by reviewing the principles behind a learning tapestry, move on to
reviewing a few example learning tapestries, then sketch out share tapestries
for our organizations.
