* How much experience does someone need before they can/should be called "senior"?
* How can senior workers help juniors build their skills?
* What are the ideal characteristics of a senior contributor?

The chat will be 6 p.m. PST/9 p.m. EST, Tuesday, April 14. To participate, use the hashtag [#apprenticeship](https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=%23Apprenticeship%20%7C%7C%20%40pprenticeship&src=typd).
