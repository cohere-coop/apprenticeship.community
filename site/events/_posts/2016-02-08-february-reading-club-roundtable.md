Books are a great way to level up your skills; so let's get together and talk about the books we're reading, share insights that we've gleaned, and maybe pick up a new read! This is a text chat in the [#\_community-events](https://apprenticeship.slack.com/messages/_community-events/) channel.


This is a members only event, so make sure you've [registered to become a member and verified your login credentials!](https://zee8.typeform.com/to/b9wyG6).
