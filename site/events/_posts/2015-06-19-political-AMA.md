Our next AMA is a treat: Aki Braun and Blithe Rocher will answer questions about working as programmers for political campaigns. Kick off election season with us.

* {% include bio-aki-braun.md %}

* {% include bio-blithe-rocher.md %}

Note: Because Blithe is working on the campaign right now, she won't be able to answer questions about which candidate she works for. Instead, ask her about what it's like to work for a political campaign, change careers, be a self-taught developer, be a former scientist or switch programming languages for a job.

The AMA will be 6 p.m. PST/9 p.m. EST, Tuesday, June 23, in the [#_community-events channel](https://apprenticeship.slack.com/messages/_community-events/) of our Slack room. Make sure you've [joined Apprenticeship Community](https://zee8.typeform.com/to/b9wyG6?invite-code=political-ama) and accepted your emailed Slack invite to participate.
