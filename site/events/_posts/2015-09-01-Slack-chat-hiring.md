We'll be discussing **how to improve tech hiring** in this week's community Slack conversation. 

* What's broken about tech hiring?
* How can it be improved?

Every other week, we host a discussion among community members about a specific topic.

The discussion will take place at 6 p.m. PST/9 p.m. EST, Tuesday, Sept. 1, in our [#_community-events](https://apprenticeship.slack.com/messages/_community-events/) Slack channel.

[Join the community](https://zee8.typeform.com/to/b9wyG6?invite-code=hiring-slack-convo) to participate.
