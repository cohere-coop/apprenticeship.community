We'll be talking about **learning new programming languages** in this week's community Slack discussion.

We host an hour-long themed discussion among community members every other week. Usually, topics are suggested by community members.

The discussion will take place at 6 p.m. PST/9 p.m. EST, Tuesday, July 28, in our [#_community-events](https://apprenticeship.slack.com/messages/_community-events/) Slack channel.

Make sure you've [joined the community](https://zee8.typeform.com/to/b9wyG6?invite-code=learning-slack-convo) to participate.
