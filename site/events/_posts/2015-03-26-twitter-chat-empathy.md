Our next #apprenticeship Twitter chat will be on the topic of **empathy**, suggested by community member [@GeekOnCoffee](http://www.twitter.com/geekoncoffee).  

*   What does empathy mean to you?
*   Can empathy be taught?
*   If so, how?

To participate, follow [@pprenticeship](http://www.twitter.com/pprenticeship) on Twitter, and use the hashtag [#apprenticeship](https://twitter.com/search?q=%40pprenticeship%20%23apprenticeship&src=typd).
