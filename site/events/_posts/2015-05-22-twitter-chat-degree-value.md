Our next #apprenticeship Twitter chat will discuss the value of a college degree.

* Does having a college degree make it easier to get a job in your industry?
* How do you evaluate job candidates who don't have degrees?
* If you have a college degree, was it "worth it"?

And more!

The chat will be 6 p.m. PST/9 p.m. EST, Tuesday, June 2. Follow [@pprenticeship](https://twitter.com/pprenticeship) on Twitter and use the hashtag [#apprenticeship](https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=%40pprenticeship%20OR%20%23apprenticeship&src=typd) to participate.
