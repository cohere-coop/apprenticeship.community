Freelancing provides an opportunity to explore new skills while picking up some extra cash. This month we'll discuss how to manage your time while freelancing; balancing customer development with delivery; and having a life.

This will be a text chat in the [#\_community-events](https://apprenticeship.slack.com/messages/_community-events/) channel.
