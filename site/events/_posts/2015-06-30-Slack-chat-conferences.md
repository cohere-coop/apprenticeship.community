We're changing up our format. Instead of doing Twitter chats every other week, we'll be hosting themed discussions among members in our [#_community-events](https://apprenticeship.slack.com/messages/_community-events/) Slack channel.

This week, we will be talking about **conferences**, including:

* Giving talks and/or
* Attending conferences
* What do you get out of them?
* How can you attend for free/cheap?

Join us for a lively discussion at 6 p.m. PST/9 p.m. PST, Tuesday, June 30. (Tonight!) Make sure you've [joined the community](https://zee8.typeform.com/to/b9wyG6) to participate.
