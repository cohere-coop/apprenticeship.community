Freelancing provides an opportunity to explore new skills or improve existing ones in a new context while picking up some extra cash. This month we'll discuss how to bid a project; covering gathering information on the project, pricing, building a formal statement of work, and presenting your bid to clients.

This will be a text chat in the [#\_community-events](https://apprenticeship.slack.com/messages/_community-events/) channel.

This is a members only event, so make sure you've [registered to become a member and verified your login credentials!](https://zee8.typeform.com/to/b9wyG6).
