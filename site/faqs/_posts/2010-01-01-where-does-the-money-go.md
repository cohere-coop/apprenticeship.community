title: Where Does The Money Go?
---
We use the money to pay authors and event special guests, our <a

href="http://twitter.com/zspencer">community caretaker</a>. We donate 10% of our
revenue (after processing fees) to [partner
organizations](https://docs.google.com/a/zincma.de/document/d/1Klu8wLu4ubZMpoIRXMwRoyzq40yLAZMwFeHvxFOKAM0/edit)
that provide sustaining, educating, and actualizing services to under-priviliged
or under-represented groups.
