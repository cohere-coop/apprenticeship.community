title: Where Does The Money Go?
---
We use the money to pay authors and event special guests, our <a

href="http://twiter.com/zspencer">community caretaker</a>. We donate 10% of our
revenue (after processing fees) to [partner
organizations](https://docs.google.com/a/zincma.de/document/d/1ClNoEFKZxIfDF5EmyNuXSu38ienGCw3hu5zXdiw_9LA/edit)
that provide sustaining, educating and actualizing services to under-priviliged
or under-represented groups.
