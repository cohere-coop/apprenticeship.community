Elijah Claude is a Haitian-American from Clayton County in Georgia. He has eclectic, erudite taste for anything that manages to make him think; meaning open world story driven action-combat games, epic orchestral dubstep music, really long sci-fi/fantasy books, action-based psychological manga, quantum theory, relativity, poetry, space, STEM, and sappy or comedy movies. He wants to make a career out of inventing technology based on outlandish open-source ideas.
