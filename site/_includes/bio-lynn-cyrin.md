[Lynn Cyrin](http://lynncyrin.me) is a web developer and writer / advocate. She founded the queer trans collective, [CollectQT](http://collectqt.me/), and is working on [Quirell](https://gitlab.com/collectqt/quirell), a social network. She has done activist writing for [Model View Culture](https://modelviewculture.com/authors/lynn-cyrin).

Lynn's specialities include [sniffing out subtle bigotry](https://modelviewculture.com/news/how-to-be-critical-of-industry-events-without-throwing-other-women-under-the-bus), [writing database queries](http://sj2neo.herokuapp.com), and creating fancy navigation bars. She is always looking for more ways to help trans women of color, homeless women and trauma survivors. When she's not doing any of those things, sheâ€™s probably playing League of Legends.
