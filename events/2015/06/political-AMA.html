<p>Our next AMA is a treat: Aki Braun and Blithe Rocher will answer questions about working as programmers for political campaigns. Kick off election season with us.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://akibraun.com">Aki Braun</a> is a nomad, a developer, a feminist and a speaker based in Southern California. She’s been tinkering in web development since the 90’s, and once even got to do so for the President of the United States. In addition to writing code, Aki advocates to make tech and tech products more accessible to people from all backgrounds. Her free time is spent working on her homestead in rural California.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://twitter.com/blithe">Blithe Rocher</a> is a backend software engineer based in Oakland, California. She works remotely for a political tech startup called The Groundwork to build technology for the next election. Prior to becoming a developer, she received a PhD in physical chemistry from the University of Southern California. When she’s not crafting web applications, she spends time traveling, riding her bike, or with her dog Nola.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Note: Because Blithe is working on the campaign right now, she won’t be able to answer questions about which candidate she works for. Instead, ask her about what it’s like to work for a political campaign, change careers, be a self-taught developer, be a former scientist or switch programming languages for a job.</p>

<p>The AMA will be 6 p.m. PST/9 p.m. EST, Tuesday, June 23, in the <a href="https://apprenticeship.slack.com/messages/_community-events/">#_community-events channel</a> of our Slack room. Make sure you’ve <a href="https://zee8.typeform.com/to/b9wyG6?invite-code=political-ama">joined Apprenticeship Community</a> and accepted your emailed Slack invite to participate.</p>
